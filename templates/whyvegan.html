<h1 class="font-extrabold text-2xl py-2 px-1">Why vegan?</h1>
<p class="py-2 px-1">Welcome to 100% Vegan. Veganism is a moral obligation.</p>

  <p class="py-2 px-1">
    "Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, 
    and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives 
    for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly 
    or partly from animals."
